    <h2>Decription :</h2>
    <p>We aren't just making flavored milk tea... When I say homemade, I mean everything. From the fresh brewed milk tea all the way down to the brown sugar syrup and the homemade tapioca pearls, also known as boba pearls!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <h4>Brown Sugar Boba Pearls & Syrup :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup packed (65g) light brown sugar, plus 1.25 cups (250g)</li>
        <li>1 cup (120g) tapioca starch, plus more to coat the boba pearls</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp (19g) blackstrap molasses</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tea Option 1 Traditional Brown Sugar Milk Tea :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (500ml) whole milk or any nut milk</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp (4g) loose leaf black tea</li>
        <li>Brown sugar boba pearls, to taste</li>
        <li>Brown sugar syrup, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tea Option 2 Matcha Boba Tea :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 tsp (6g) matcha powder</li>
        <li>2 cups (500ml) whole milk or any nut milk</li>
        <li>Brown sugar boba pearls, to taste</li>
        <li>Brown sugar syrup, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <h4>Brown Sugar Boba Pearls and Syrup :</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine 1/3 cup (78ml) water and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce the heat to low. Using a rubber spatula, vigorously mix in half of the tapioca starch stirring constantly for 6-8 seconds. Remove from the heat and mix in the remaining half of the tapioca starch until thoroughly combined and a dough just begins to form.</li>
        <li>Dump the dough out onto a work surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Working quickly, as the dough will stiffen as it cools, divide the dough into four equal pieces and roll each piece into a very long, skinny rod that is ½” (12mm)  thick. Cut the rod into small cubes and then roll the cubes into tiny balls. (If the dough firms up, heat in the microwave for about 3 seconds or until it’s pliable again.)</li>
        <li>Place the boba pearls into a bowl with tapioca starch and toss to evenly coat. Dump the pearls into a fine-mesh sieve and shake off the excess starch. Store the boba pearls in an airtight container in the freezer or use immediately.</li>
        <li>To cook the boba pearls, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the pearls and boil for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pearls steep for 20-25 minutes or until translucent and chewy.</li>
        <li>While the pearls steep, prepare the brown sugar syrup. Into a small saucepan, add 6.5 tablespoons (100ml) water and the remaining 1.25 cups (250g) of light brown sugar. Swirl to hydrate the sugar. Heat over medium and cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts to bubble.  Increase the heat to medium-high and boil vigorously to reduce the liquid into a syrup. When large bubbles form on the surface, check the thickness by placing a dollop of syrup on a plate, let cool slightly, and then press the syrup between your fingers. If the syrup stretches between your fingers and feels thick, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Drain the steeped pearls through a fine-mesh strainer and transfer into the brown sugar syrup. Add the molasses and stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Traditional Brown Sugar Milk Tea :</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the milk to a small saucepan and heat over medium until it reaches 162°F (72°C), stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and mix in the black tea. Steep for 4-8 minutes, or until it reaches the desired strength of flavor. Strain the tea through a fine-mesh strainer before cooling in the refrigerator or over an ice bath before using. (You can also prepare a large batch of the milk tea and store in the refrigerator to have on hand.) </li>
        <li>To a tall glass, spoon in as many boba pearls as desired and top with desired amount of syrup. Add ice cubes and pour in the chilled milk tea. Serve with a stainless steel boba straw.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Matcha Milk Tea :</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, create a matcha concentrate by whisking together the matcha powder and 2 Tbsp (30ml) hot water until combined.  it should have the consistency of heavy cream.</li>
        <li>To a tall glass, spoon in as many boba pearls as desired and top with desired amount of syrup. Add ice cubes and then pour milk over the ice, leaving room at the top for the matcha. Pour the matcha mixture into the glass, stir to combine with a stainless steel boba straw and serve.</li>
    </ol>
